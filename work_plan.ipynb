Specifically, the data will be analyzed in terms of what factors contribute to Interconnect users discontinuing use of services. By the data, a binary classification machine learning model will be trained so that Interconnect can use it to predict which of their current users are likely to leave at any given time. This will allow Intercom to offer promotional codes and/or special plan options to insentivize said users to stay. The goal of this project is to maximize the model's AUC-ROC score, a metric ranging from 0 to 1 that measures how well a classification model distinguishes between classes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Project Plan"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Load
